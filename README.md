Full Stack Social Media application for Domestic Violence advocates. This project was created to bring support awareness through modern-day technology. As a volunteer in the community for over seven years, It's a way I can assist in allowing men and women to come forth and receive assistance. It's also a great way for continued education for survivors and others interested in learning the signs of all types of abuse.
